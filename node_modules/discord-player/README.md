## [Documentation](https://discord-player.js.org)

## Getting Started

First of all, you will need to register slash commands:

```js
const { REST } = require('@discordjs/rest');
const { Routes, ApplicationCommandOptionType } = require('discord.js');

const commands = [
    {
        name: 'play',
        description: 'Plays a song!',
        options: [
            {
                name: 'query',
                type: ApplicationCommandOptionType.String,
                description: 'The song you want to play',
                required: true
            }
        ]
    }
];

const rest = new REST({ version: '10' }).setToken('BOT_TOKEN');

(async () => {
    try {
        console.log('Started refreshing application [/] commands.');

        await rest.put(Routes.applicationGuildCommands(CLIENT_ID, GUILD_ID), { body: commands });

        console.log('Successfully reloaded application [/] commands.');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
})();
```

Now you can implement your bot's logic:

```js
const { Client } = require('discord.js');
const client = new Discord.Client({
    intents: ['Guilds', 'GuildVoiceStates']
});
const { Player } = require('discord-player');

// Create a new Player (you don't need any API Key)
const player = new Player(client);

// add the start and finish event so when a song will be played this message will be sent
player.events.on('playerStart', (queue, track) => queue.metadata.channel.send(`üé∂ | Now playing **${track.title}**!`));
player.events.on('playerFinish', (queue, track) => queue.metadata.channel.send(`üé∂ | Now playing **${track.title}**!`));

client.once('ready', () => {
    console.log("I'm ready !");
});

client.on('interactionCreate', async (interaction) => {
    if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;

    // /play track:Despacito
    // will play "Despacito" in the voice channel
    if (interaction.commandName === 'play') {
        const voiceChannel = interaction.member.voice.channelId;
        if (!voiceChannel) return await interaction.reply({ content: 'You are not in a voice channel!', ephemeral: true });
        if (interaction.guild.members.me.voice.channelId && voiceChannel !== interaction.guild.members.me.voice.channelId)
            return await interaction.reply({ content: 'You are not in my voice channel!', ephemeral: true });
        await interaction.deferReply({ ephemeral: true });
        const query = interaction.options.getString('query');

        try {
            const res = await player.play(voiceChannel, query, {
                nodeOptions: {
                    metadata: {
                        channel: interaction.channel
                    }
                }
            });

            return await interaction.followUp({ content: `‚è±Ô∏è | Loading track **${res.track.title}**!` });
        } catch(e) {
            return await interaction.followUp({ content: `Could not play: ${e.message}`, ephemeral: true });
        }
    }
});

client.login('BOT_TOKEN');
```

### Accessing player instance

Polluting client like this could be a bad idea:

```js
client.player = player;
```

discord-player provides singleton support to avoid this type of pollution:

```diff
- const player = new Player(client);
+ const player = Player.singleton(client);
```

`Player.singleton()` creates a single instance of player which is shared in the future. You can simply do `Player.singleton()` to access player instance whenever
you want without polluting client.

## Supported sources

By default, discord-player **does not support anything** (including search operation and streaming). Luckily, discord-player supports the following sources with the help of [@discord-player/extractor](https://npm.im/@discord-player/extractor) which comes pre-installed with discord-player:

-   Local file (You must set the search engine to `QueryType.FILE` in order to play local files, backed by `attachment extractor`)
-   Raw attachments (backed by `attachment extractor`)
-   Spotify (backed by `ysa extractor`)
-   Apple Music (backed by `ysa extractor`)
-   YouTube (backed by `ysa extractor`)
-   Vimeo (backed by `vimeo extractor`)
-   Reverbnation (backed by `reverbnation extractor`)
-   SoundCloud (backed by `soundcloud extractor`)

If you dont want to stream from certain extractors, you can block them by passing `blockStreamFrom: [id, id, ...]` to player instantiation options.
Disabling youtube streaming completely would be as easy as:

```js
import { Player } from 'discord-player';
import { YouTubeExtractor } from '@discord-player/extractor';

const player = new Player(client, {
    blockStreamFrom: [
        // now your bot will no longer be able to use
        // youtube extractor to play audio even if the track was
        // extracted from youtube
        YouTubeExtractor.identifier
    ],
    blockExtractors: [
        // this will block the listed extractors from being
        // able to query metadata (aka search results parsing)
        // This example disables youtube search, spotify bridge
        // and apple music bridge
        YouTubeExtractor.identifier
    ]
});
```

Likewise, You can also force a specific extractor to resolve your search query. This is useful in some cases where you don't want to use other sources.

You can do so by using `ext:<EXTRACTOR_IDENTIFIER>` in `searchEngine` value. Example:

```js
import { SoundCloudExtractor } from '@discord-player/extractor';

const result = await player.search(query, {
    // always use soundcloud extractor
    searchEngine: SoundCloudExtractor.identifier
});
```

### Adding more sources

Discord Player provides an **Extractor API** that enables you to use your custom stream extractor with it. Some packages have been made by the community to add new features using this API.

## Audio Filters

Discord Player supports various audio filters. There are 4 types of audio filters in discord-player.

##### FFmpeg

The most common and powerful method is FFmpeg. It supports a lot of audio filters. To set ffmpeg filter, you can do:

```js
await queue.filters.ffmpeg.toggle(['bassboost', 'nightcore']);
```

Note that there can be a delay between filters transition in this method.

##### Equalizer

This equalizer is very similar to Lavalink's 15 Band Equalizer. To use this, you can do:

```js
queue.filters.equalizer.setEQ([
    { band: 0, gain: 0.25 },
    { band: 1, gain: 0.25 },
    { band: 2, gain: 0.25 }
]);
```

There is no delay between filter transition when using equalizer.

##### Biquad

This filter provides digital biquad filterer to the player. To use this, you can do:

```js
import { BiquadFilterType } from 'discord-player';

queue.filters.biquad.setFilter(BiquadFilterType.LowPass);
// similarly, you can use other filters such as HighPass, BandPass, Notch, PeakEQ, LowShelf, HighShelf, etc.
```

There is no delay between filter transition when using biquad filters.

#### Mini Audio Filters

This is another type of audio filters provider. It currently supports `Tremolo` and `8D` filters only. To use this, you can do:

```js
queue.filters.filters.setFilters(['8D']);
```

There is no delay between filters transition using this filter.

### Use youtube cookies

Using youtube cookies helps you to prevent frequent ratelimits.

```js
const player = new Player(client, {
    ytdlOptions: {
        requestOptions: {
            headers: {
                cookie: 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_COOKIE'
            }
        }
    }
});
```

> Note: The above option is also passed to `ytdl-core` but not `play-dl`. Follow [this instruction](https://github.com/play-dl/play-dl/blob/1ae7ba8fcea8b93293af5de9e19eca3c2a491804/instructions/README.md) for play-dl config.

### Use custom proxies

```js
const HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// Remove "user:pass@" if you don't need to authenticate to your proxy.
const proxy = 'http://user:pass@111.111.111.111:8080';
const agent = HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);

const player = new Player(client, {
    ytdlOptions: {
        requestOptions: { agent }
    }
});
```

> You may also create a simple proxy server and forward requests through it.
> See **[https://github.com/http-party/node-http-proxy](https://github.com/http-party/node-http-proxy)** for more info.

## Stream Hooks

### onBeforeCreateStream

Discord Player by default uses registered extractors to stream audio. If you need to override what needs to be streamed, you can use this hook.

```js
const fs = require('fs');

// other code
const queue = player.nodes.create(..., {
    ...,
    async onBeforeCreateStream(track, source, _queue) {
        if (track.title === 'some title') {
            return fs.createReadStream('./playThisInstead.mp3');
        }
    }
});
```

`<GuildQueue>.onBeforeCreateStream` is called before actually downloading the stream. It is a different concept from extractors, where you are **just** downloading
streams. `source` here will be a track source. Streams from `onBeforeCreateStream` are then piped to `FFmpeg` and sent to `onAfterCreateStream` hook.

### onAfterCreateStream

This hook can be used to post-process pcm stream. This is the final step before creating audio resource. Example:

```js
const queue = player.nodes.create(..., {
    ...,
    async onAfterCreateStream(pcmStream, queue) {
        // return opus encoded stream
        const encoder = new OpusEncoder();
        return {
            stream: encoder.encode(pcmStream),
            type: StreamType.Opus
        };
    }
});
```
